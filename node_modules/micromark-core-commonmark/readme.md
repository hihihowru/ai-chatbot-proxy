[micromark](https://github.com/micromark/micromark) constructs that make up the core of CommonMark. Some of these can be [turned off](https://github.com/micromark/micromark#case-turn-off-constructs), but they are often essential to markdown and weird things might happen.

## What is this?

This package exposes the default constructs.

## When should I use this?

This package is useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c). In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

```sh
npm install micromark-core-commonmark
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`](https://esm.sh):

```js
import * as core from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-core-commonmark@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`](https://esm.sh):

```html
<script type="module">
  import * as core from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-core-commonmark@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {autolink} from 'micromark-core-commonmark'

console.log(autolink) // Do things with `autolink`.
```

## API

This module exports the following identifiers: `attention`, `autolink`, `blankLine`, `blockQuote`, `characterEscape`, `characterReference`, `codeFenced`, `codeIndented`, `codeText`, `content`, `definition`, `hardBreakEscape`, `headingAtx`, `htmlFlow`, `htmlText`, `labelEnd`, `labelStartImage`, `labelStartLink`, `lineEnding`, `list`, `setextUnderline`, `thematicBreak`. There is no default export.

Each identifier refers to a [construct](https://github.com/micromark/micromark#constructs).

See the code for more on the exported constructs.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of Node. This means we try to keep the current release line, `micromark-core-commonmark@2`, compatible with Node.js 16. This package works with `micromark@3`.

## Security

This package is safe. See [`security.md`](https://github.com/micromark/.github/blob/main/security.md) in [`micromark/.github`](https://github.com/micromark/.github) for how to submit a security report.
