## What is this?

This package contains info on attributes that have URLs as values.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package any time you’re rewriting URLs.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c). In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

```sh
npm install html-url-attributes
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`](https://esm.sh):

```js
import {urlAttributes} from 'https://esm.sh/html-url-attributes@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`](https://esm.sh):

```html
<script type="module">
  import {urlAttributes} from 'https://esm.sh/html-url-attributes@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {urlAttributes} from 'html-url-attributes'

console.log(urlAttributes.formAction)
//=> ['button', 'input']
console.log(urlAttributes.href)
//=> ['a', 'area', 'base', 'link']
```

## API

This package exports the identifier `urlAttributes`. There is no default export.

### `urlAttributes`

HTML URL properties (`Record<string, Array<string> | null>`).

Each key is a property name and each value is a list of tag names it applies to or `null` if it applies to all elements.

## Syntax

HTML is parsed according to WHATWG HTML (the living standard), which is also followed by all browsers.

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree used is [hast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of Node. This means we try to keep the current release line, `html-url-attributes@^3`, compatible with Node.js 16.

## Security

As **rehype** works on HTML and improper use of HTML can open you up to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attack, use of rehype can also be unsafe. Use [`rehype-sanitize`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-sanitize) to make the tree safe.
