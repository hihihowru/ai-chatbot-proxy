## What is this?

This is a tiny package that finds the count of the longest adjacent repeating substring.

## When should I use this?

This package is rather niche. I use it for serializing markdown ASTs (particularly fenced code and math).

You can use [`ccount`](https://github.com/wooorm/ccount) if you need the total count of substrings occuring in a value.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c). In Node.js (version 14.14+, 16.0+), install with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

```sh
npm install longest-streak
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`](https://esm.sh):

```js
import {longestStreak} from 'https://esm.sh/longest-streak@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`](https://esm.sh):

```html
<script type="module">
  import {longestStreak} from 'https://esm.sh/longest-streak@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {longestStreak} from 'longest-streak'

longestStreak('` foo `` bar `', '`') // => 2
```

## API

This package exports the identifier `longestStreak`. There is no default export.

### `longestStreak(value, substring)`

Get the count of the longest repeating streak of `substring` in `value`.

**Parameters**

* `value` (`string`) — content to search in
* `substring` (`string`) — substring to look for, typically one character

**Returns**

Count of most frequent adjacent `substring`s in `value` (`number`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

This package is at least compatible with all maintained versions of Node.js. As of now, that is Node.js 14.14+ and 16.0+. It also works in Deno and modern browsers.

## Security

This package is safe.
