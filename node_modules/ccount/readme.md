## What is this?

This package is a small utility that helps you find how frequently a substring occurs in another string.

## When should I use this?

I find this particularly useful when generating code, for example, when building a string that can either be double or single quoted. I use this utility to choose single quotes when double quotes are used more frequently, and double quotes otherwise.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c). In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

```sh
npm install ccount
```

```js
import {ccount} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/ccount@2?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev):

```html
<script type="module">
  import {ccount} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/ccount@2?min'

```js
import {ccount} from 'ccount'

ccount('foo(bar(baz)', '(') // => 2
ccount('foo(bar(baz)', ')') // => 1
```

## API

### `ccount(value, character)`

Count how often a character (or substring) is used in a string.

**Parameters**

* `value` (`string`) — value to search in

**Returns**

`number` — number of times `character` occurred in `value`.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

## Compatibility

This package is at least compatible with all maintained versions of Node.js. As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+. It also works in Deno and modern browsers.

## Security

This package is safe.
