## What is this?

This is a list of certain named character references, that due to legacy reasons, don’t need a trailing semicolon in HTML. For example, `&copy` is perfectly fine for `©`!

## When should I use this?

Maybe when you’re writing an HTML parser or minifier, but otherwise probably never! Even then, it might be better to use [`parse-entities`](https://github.com/wooorm/parse-entities) or [`stringify-entities`](https://github.com/wooorm/stringify-entities).
